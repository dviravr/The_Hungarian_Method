## How to run the algorithm:
  
* To add Nodes click on the + button of every group.

* To connect nodes click on two nodes.
  the first click will paint the node in yellow, the second will connect the nodes.
  
* Right click on node/edge will remove them. 

* After you finish to set up the graph, you can start the algorithm in two ways:
  * Click on the `Start Algorithm`, this will immediately color all the matches in red.
  * Click on the `Step By Step`, this will color the matches on at a time.

#### notice:
* You can add or remove nodes and edges any time.
* You can't connect a node to another node that is on the same group. 
* When you remove node, you remove all the edges that connect to him.
* Click on a crossroads will remove all the edges in that crossroads.
* You can choose the time between every step by changing the slider value (ms). 
* You have a help button.

### How to run:

* clone the project to your computer: `git clone https://github.com/dviravr/The_Hungarian_Method.git`

* Now you can choose between run the main program or run `java -jar TheHungarianMethod.jar` from the CMD.
